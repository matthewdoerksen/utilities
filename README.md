# utilities

This repo is used to house the many small utilities that can be re-used between projects such as:
- the custom Response type used to wrap objects and provide useful info 
- the JSON deserializer
- a message formatter (in the format of that presented by slf4j)
- the New Relic API (not the jar/server set up required in order to send information to the portal)
